These files were from UCM's CIS 2625 Web Architecture Class final project utilizing AWS databases, lambda functions, API's and more. I created a user input page in which an owner can list their property for rent with all the standard information: address, bed, bath, picture upload, etc., to a database and then recalled and displayed for visiting users who are interested in renting. The website is similar, perhaps a tad more crude, in design to how Zillow operates. Coding includes html, python, javascript, and css.
